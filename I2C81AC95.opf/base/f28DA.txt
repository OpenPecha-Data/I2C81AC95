XXXII At that moment again Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva said this to the Blessed One:Pray tell me, Blessed One, ab
out the teaching known as the essence of discrimination as regards words, whereby, Blessed One, I and other Bodhisattva-
Mahāsattvas, comprehending and becoming well acquainted with the essence of discrimination as regards words, will be tho
roughly informed of the signification of two things, expression and expressed, and, thereby immediately attaining suprem
e enlightenment, will explain the signification of these two things, expression and expressed, for the purification of a
ll beings.Replied the Blessed One: Then, Mahāmati, listen well and reflect well, (86) for I will tell you about it.Well 
done! said Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva and listened to the Blessed One.The Blessed One said this to him: There a
re, Mahāmati, four kinds of word-discrimination.They are: (1) Words denoting individual marks, (2) dream-words, (3) word
s growing out of the attachment to erroneous speculations and discriminations, and (4) words growing out of the discrimi
nation that knows no beginning.

Now, Mahāmati, the words denoting individual marks rise from discriminating forms and characteristic signs as real in the
mselves and becoming attached to them.The dream-words, Mahāmati, rise from the unreal surroundings which reveal themselv
es [before the mind] when it recollects its previous experience.The words growing out of the attachment to erroneous spe
culations and discriminations, Mahāmati, rise from recollecting deeds once previously committed.The words growing out of
the discrimination that has been functioning since beginningless time, Mahāmati, rise from the habit-energy whose seeds
have been growing out of the clinging to erroneous speculations and false imaginations since beginningless time.I say, 
Mahāmati, these are the four features of word-discrimination, which is the answer to your question.
