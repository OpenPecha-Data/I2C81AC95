(62) They are not aware, Mahāmati, of the fact that Nirvāṇa is the Ālayavijñāna where a revulsion takes place by self-rea
lisation.Therefore, Mahāmati, those who are stupid talk of the trinity of vehicles and not of the state of Mind-only whe
re there are no images.Therefore, Mahāmati, those who do not understand the teachings of the Tathāgatas of the past, pre
sent, and future, concerning the external world, which is of Mind itself, cling to the notion that there is a world outs
ide what is seen of the Mindand, Mahāmati, go on rolling themselves along the wheel of birth-and-death.XIX Further, Mahā
mati, according to the teaching of the Tathāgatas of the past, present, and future, all things are unborn.
