XI(a) Further, Mahāmati, when the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva establishes himself in the abode where he has gained a thorough 
understanding of Mind by means of his transcendental knowledge, he should later discipline himself in the cultivation of
noble wisdom in its triple aspect.What are the three aspects of noble wisdom, Mahāmati, in which he has to discipline h
imself later? They are: (1) imagelessness; (2) the power added by all the Buddhas by reason of their original vows; and 
(3) the self-realisation attained by noble wisdom.Having mastered them, (50) the Yogin should abandon his knowledge of M
ind gained by means of transcendental wisdom, which still resembles a lame donkey; and entering upon the eighth stage of
Bodhisattvahood, he should further discipline himself in these three aspects of noble wisdom.

Then again, Mahāmati, the aspect of imagelessness comes forth when all things belonging to the Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddh
as and philosophers are thoroughly mastered.Again, Mahāmati, as to the power added, it comes from the original vows made
by all the Buddhas.Again, Mahāmati, as to the self-realisation aspect of noble wisdom, it rises when a Bodhisattva, det
aching himself from viewing all things in their phenomenality, realises the Samādhi-body whereby he surveys the world as
like unto a vision, and further goes on to the attainment of the Buddha-stage.Mahāmati, this is the triplicity of the n
oble life. Furnished with this triplicity, noble ones will attain the state of self-realisation which is the outcome of 
noble wisdom.For this reason, Mahāmati, you should cultivate noble wisdom in its triple aspect.
