[What are the three? They are (1) false discrimination, (2) knowledge of relativity, and (3) perfect knowledge.] Now, Mah
āmati, false discrimination rises from form (nimitta).How, Mahāmati, does it rise from form? In [the consideration of] t
he relativity aspect of Svabhāva, realities appear in various ways, as having forms, signs, and shapes;when, Mahāmati, t
hese objects, forms, and signs are adhered to [as real], this adherence takes place in two ways.The Tathāgatas, Arhats, 
and Fully-Enlightened Ones thus declare false discrimination to consist in attachment to names and attachment to objects
.By the attachment to objects is meant, Mahāmati, to get attached to inner and external things [as realities].By the att
achment to names is meant to recognise in these inner and external things the characteristic marks of individuality and 
generality and to regard them as definitely belonging to the objects.These two modes of attachment, Mahāmati, constitute
false discrimination.The knowledge of the relativity-aspect (paratantra) rises from the separation of subject (asraya) 
and object (alambana).Now, Mahāmati, what is perfect knowledge? It is realised when one casts aside the discriminating n
otions of form, name, reality, and character; it is the inner realisation by noble wisdom.This (68) perfect knowledge, M
ahāmati, is the essence of the Tathāgata-garbha.Then the Blessed One recited this verse:134 Form, Name, and Discriminati
on [correspond to] the two forms of Svabhāva, and Right Knowledge and Suchness [correspond to] the Perfect Knowledge asp
