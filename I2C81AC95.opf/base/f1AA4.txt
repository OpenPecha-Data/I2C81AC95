XXXV At that time Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva again (89) said this to the Blessed One:Pray tell me, Blessed One, 
about the attainment of self-realisation by noble wisdom, which does not belong to the path and the usage of the philoso
phers; which is devoid of [all such predicates as] being and non-being, oneness and otherness, bothness and not-bothness
, existence and non-existence, eternity and non-eternity;which has nothing to do with the false imagination, nor with in
dividuality and generality; which manifests itself as the truth of highest reality;which, going up continuously by degre
es the stages of purification, enters upon the stage of Tathāgatahood;which, because of the original vows unattended by 
any striving, will perform its works in infinite worlds like a gem reflecting a variety of colours; and which is manifes
ted [when one perceives how] signs of individuation rise in all things as one realises the course and realm of what is s
een of Mind itself,and thereby I and other Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas are enabled to survey things from the point of view w
hich is not hampered by marks of individuality and generality nor by anything of the false imagination, and may quickly 
attain supreme enlightenment and enable all beings to achieve the perfection of all their virtues.

Replied the Blessed One: Well done, well done, Mahāmati! and again, well done, indeed, Mahāmati!Because of your compassio
n for the world, for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, for the welfare, benefit, happiness o
f many people, both of celestial beings and humankind, Mahāmati, you present yourself before me and make this request.Th
erefore, Mahāmati, listen well and truly, and reflect, for I will tell you.Assuredly, said Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahā
sattva, and gave ear to the Blessed One.(90) The Blessed One said this to him: Mahāmati, since the ignorant and the simp
le-minded, not knowing that the world is what is seen of Mind itself, cling to the multitudinousness of external objects
, cling to the notions of being and non-being, oneness and otherness, bothness and not-bothness, existence and non-exist
ence, eternity and non-eternity, as being characterised by self-nature which rises from discrimination based on habit-en
ergy, they are addicted to false imaginings.Mahāmati, it is like a mirage in which the springs are seen as if they were 
real. They are imagined so by the animals who, thirsty from the heat of the season, would run after them.Not knowing tha
t the springs are their own mental hallucinations, the animals do not realise that there are no such springs.In the same
way, Mahāmati, the ignorant and simple-minded with their minds impressed by various erroneous speculations and discrimi
nations since beginningless time; with their minds burning with the fire of greed, anger, and folly; delighted in a worl
d of multitudinous forms; with their thoughts saturated with the ideas of birth, destruction, and subsistence; not under
standing well what is meant by existent and non-existent, by inner and outer;the ignorant and simple-minded fall into th
e way of grasping at oneness and otherness, being and non-being.Mahāmati, it is like the city of the Gandharvas which th
e unwitted take for a real city, though it is not so in fact.This city appears in essence owing to their attachment to t
he memory of a city preserved in seed from beginningless time.This city is thus neither existent nor non-existent.In the
same way, Mahāmati, clinging to the memory (vasana) of erroneous speculations and doctrines since beginningless time, t
hey hold fast to ideas such as oneness and otherness, being and non-being, and their thoughts are not at all clear about
what is seen of Mind-only.(91) Mahāmati, it is like a man, who, dreaming in his sleep of a country variously filled wit
h women, men, elephants, horses, cars, pedestrians, villages, towns, hamlets, cows, buffalos, mansions, woods, mountains
, rivers, and lakes enters into its inner appartments and is awakened.While awakened thus, he recollects the city and it
s inner apartments.What do you think, Mahāmati? Is this person to be regarded as wise, who is recollecting the various u
nrealities he has seen in his dream? Said Mahāmati: Indeed, he is not, Blessed One.The Blessed One continued: In the sam
e way the ignorant and simple-minded who are bitten by erroneous views and are inclined toward the philosophers, do not 
recognise that things seen of the Mind itself are like a dream, and are held fast by the notions of oneness and othernes
s, of being and non-being.Mahāmati, it is like the painter's canvas on which there is no depression nor elevation as ima
gined by the ignorant.In the same way, Mahāmati, there may be in the future some people brought up in the habit-energy, 
mentality, and imagination based on the philosophers' erroneous views;clinging to the ideas of oneness and otherness, of
bothness and not-bothness, they may bring themselves and others to ruin; they may declare those people nihilists who ho
ld the doctrine of no-birth apart from the alternatives of being and non-being.They [argue against] cause and effect, th
ey are followers of the wicked views whereby they uproot meritorious causes of unstained purity.They are to be kept far 
away by those whose desires are for things excellent.They are those whose thoughts are entangled in the errors of self, 
other, and both, (92) in the errors of imagining being and non-being, assertion and refutation, and hell will be their f
inal refuge.Mahāmati, it is like the dim-eyed ones who, seeing a hair-net, would exclaim to one another, saying: “It is 
wonderful! it is wonderful! Look, O honourable sirs!"And the said hair-net has never been brought into existence. It is 
in fact neither an entity nor a non-entity, because it is seen and not seen.In the same manner, Mahāmati, those whose mi
nds are addicted to discrimination of the erroneous views as cherished by the philosophers, and who are also given up to
the realistic ideas of being and non-being, oneness and otherness, bothness and not-bothness, will contradict the good 
Dharma, ending in the destruction of themselves and others.Mahāmati, it is like a firebrand-wheel which is no real wheel
but which is imagined to be of such character by the ignorant, but not by the wise......
