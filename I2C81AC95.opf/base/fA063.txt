VI Again, Mahāmati, there are seven kinds of first principle [or highest reality, Paramārtha]: the world of thought (citt
a-gocara), the world of knowledge (jñāna-), the world of super-knowledge (prajñā-), the world of dualistic views (dṛṣṭi-
), the world beyond dualistic views, the world beyond the Bodhisattva-stages, and a world where the Tathāgata attains hi
s self-realisation.1

(40) Mahāmati, this is the self-nature, the first principle, the essence, which constitutes the being of the Tathāgatas, 
Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones of the past, present, and future, whereby, perfecting things of this world and of a world
beyond this, they, by means of a noble eye of transcendental wisdom, enter into various phases of existence, individual
and general, and establish them.And what is thus established by them is not to be confused with the erroneous teachings
generally held by the philosophers.Mahāmati, what are these erroneous teachings accepted generally by the philosophers?
[Their error lies in this] that they do not recognise an objective world to be of Mind itself which is erroneously discr
iminated;and, not understanding the nature of the Vijñānas which are also no more than manifestations of Mind, like simp
le-minded ones that they are, they cherish the dualism of being and non-being where there is but [one] self-nature and [
one] first principle.Again, Mahāmati, my teaching consists in the cessation of sufferings arising from the discriminatio
n of the triple world; in the cessation of ignorance, desire, deed, and causality; and in the recognition that an object
ive world, like a vision, is the manifestation of Mind itself.
