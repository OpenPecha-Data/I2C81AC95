XI(b) At that moment, Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva knowing what was going on in the minds of the Bodhisattvas who 
were gathered there, and empowered by the power added to him by all the Buddhas, asked the Blessed One concerning the do
ctrine known as examining into the reality of noble wisdom.Tell me, Blessed One, the doctrine of examining into the real
ity of noble wisdom, depending on which the one hundred and eight statements are to be distinguished—the doctrine depend
ing on which the Tathāgatas, Arhats, Fully-Enlightened Ones will analyse and disclose the nature and course of false ima
gination for the sake of (51) the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas who have fallen into the way of looking at things from their a
spects of generality and individuality.Thus the Bodhisattvas will be instructed in the analysis and thorough examination
of false imagination, and thereby they will have the passage purified which leads to the egolessness of things and pers
ons, and get an illumination on the stages of Bodhisattvahood; and, further, going beyond the bliss of the tranquillisat
ions1 belonging to all the Śrāvakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and philosophers, will attain the Dharmakaya of the Tathāgata, whi
ch belongs to the realm and course of Tathāgatahood transcending thought and in which there is no rising of the five Dha
rmas. That is to say, they will attain the Tathāgata-body which is the Dharma intimately bound up with the understanding
born of transcendental knowledge, and which, entering into the realm of Māyā, reaches all the Buddha-lands, the heavenl
y mansions of Tuṣita, and the abode of the Akaniṣṭha.
