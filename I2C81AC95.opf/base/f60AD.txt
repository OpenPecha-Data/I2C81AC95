§I1 (22) At that time Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva who had visited all the Buddha-lands, together with all the Bod
hisattvas, rose from his seat by the power of the Buddhas, drawing his upper garment over one shoulder, placing his righ
t knee on the ground and with folded hands, turning in the direction of the Blessed One, respectfully saluted him, and p
raised him with the following verses:

1. As thou reviewest the world with thy transcendental knowledge and compassion, it is to thee like an ethereal flower, o
f which one cannot say whether it is born or destroyed, as [the category of] being and non-being is inapplicable to it.

2. As thou reviewest all things with thy transcendental knowledge and compassion, they are to thee like visions, they are
beyond the reach of intellectual grasp, as [the category of] being and non-being is inapplicable to them.

3. As thou reviewest the world with thy transcendental knowledge and compassion, it is to thee always like a dream, of wh
ich one cannot say whether it is permanent or destructible, as [the category of] being and non-being is inapplicable to 
it.

4. In the Dharmakaya, whose self-nature is like a vision or a dream, what is there to praise? When no thought arises as t
o existence or as to not-having-self-nature, then there is praise.

5. Of a thing whose appearance is not visible because of its being beyond the senses and their objects (23), how can it b
e praised or blamed, O Muni?

6. With thy transcendental knowledge and compassion which are above form, thou comprehendest the egolessness of things an
d persons, and art thyself always clean and free from the hindrances of passion and knowledge.

7. Thou dost not vanish in Nirvāṇa, nor is Nirvāṇa abiding in thee; for it transcends the duality of knowing and known an
d of being and non-being.

8. Those who see the Muni so serene and beyond birth [and death] will be cleansed of attachment, stainless both in this w
orld and in the other.
