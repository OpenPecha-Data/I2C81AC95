XXXIII At that time again, Mahāmati the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva requested of the Blessed One to speak on this subject:Pray
tell me again, Blessed One, about the conditions whereby the word-discrimination manifests itself.Where, whence, how, a
nd by whom do words indicating discrimination take place among the people?Said the Blessed One: Mahāmati, the word-discr
imination goes on taking place by the coordination of the head, chest, nose, throat, palate, lips, tongue, and teeth.Sai
d Mahāmati; Again, Blessed One, (87) are words to be considered different (anya) or not-different (ananya) from discrimi
nation?Replied the Blessed One: Mahāmati, they are neither different nor not-different.Why? Because words rise, Mahāmati
, with discrimination as their cause.If, Mahāmati, words are different from discrimination, they cannot have it for caus
e.Then if they are not different, words cannot express the sense, which they do.Therefore, words and discrimination are 
neither different nor not-different.

Then Mahāmati said: Again, Blessed One, are words themselves the highest reality? or is what is expressed in words the hi
ghest reality?The Blessed One replied: Mahāmati, words are not the highest reality, nor is what is expressed in words th
e highest reality.Why? Because the highest reality is an exalted state of bliss, and as it cannot be entered into by mer
e statements regarding it, words are not the highest reality.Mahāmati, the highest reality is to be attained by the inne
r realisation of noble wisdom; it is not a state of word-discrimination;therefore, discrimination does not express the h
ighest reality.And then, Mahāmati, words are subject to birth and destruction; they are unsteady, mutually conditioning,
and are produced by the law of causation.And again, Mahāmati, what is mutually conditioning and produced by the law of 
causation cannot express the highest reality, because the indications [pointing to the distinction between] self and not
-self are non-existent.Mahāmati, words are these indications and do not express [the highest reality].

(88) Further, Mahāmati, word-discrimination cannot express the highest reality, for external objects with their multitudi
nous individual marks are non-existent, and only appear before us as something revealed out of Mind itself.Therefore, Ma
hāmati, you must try to keep yourself away from the various forms of word-discrimination.
