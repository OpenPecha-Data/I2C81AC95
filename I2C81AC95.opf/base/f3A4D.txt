g that has been going on since beginningless time, and also thinking of the state of Buddhahood which is imageless and u
nborn, [the Bodhisattva] will become thoroughly conversant with the noble truth of self-realisation, will become a perfe
ct master of his own mind, will conduct himself without effort, will be like a gem reflecting a variety of colours, will
be able to assume the body of transformation, will be able to enter into the subtle minds of all beings, and, because o
f his firm belief in the truth of Mind-only, will, by gradually ascending the stages, become established in Buddhahood.T
herefore, Mahāmati, let the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva be well disciplined in self-realisation.
